My name is Orawan, I have a passion for data science and am studying TensorFlow, Keras, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc. to become a data scientist.

After graduating from Kasetsart University, Sriracha Campus, Faculty of Computer Science I am working as a Java Programmer, it's a good job. But I feel myself stagnating as the world evolves and focuses on AI and machine learning.

I decided to study Master's degree. Faculty of  Computer Engineering in Big data and Machine Intelligence at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Core courses include Random Processes and Statistical Analysis, Algorithm for Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Big data Analytics And Business Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

After completing the course, I feel that the skills are not enough to start an entry-level data science job. Therefore take online courses to gain skills and experience

My goal is not to stop learning to become a data science expert.
