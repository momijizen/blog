My name is **ORAWAM MANGMEE**, I have a passion for data science and am studying *_TensorFlow, Keras, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc._* to become a *_data scientist._*

After graduating from *Kasetsart University, Sriracha Campus*, Faculty of Computer Science I am working as a Java Programmer, it's a good job. But I feel myself stagnating as the world evolves and focuses on AI and machine learning.

I decided to study Master's degree. Faculty of  Computer Engineering in Big data and Machine Intelligence at *_King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang_*,

Core courses include
  * Random Processes and Statistical Analysis
  * Algorithm for Data Science
  * Artificial Intelligence
  * Big data Analytics And Business Intelligence
  * Machine Learning
  * Deep Learning*

After completing the course, I feel that the skills are not enough to start an entry-level data science job. Therefore take online courses to gain skills and experience

My goal is not to stop learning to become a data science expert.
